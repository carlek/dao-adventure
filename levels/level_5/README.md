# Level 5 - Showing your face to the world
## Introduction
It's time! 
You have built the foundational structure for your DAO.
By now, it's time to go public and show your vision to the rest of the world. 

A simple way to do this is to build a website that will allow anyone to see the name, manifesto, goals and some statistics about your DAO. We will also add a logo!
## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Yes, canisters are able to serve web content! We will leverage this feature in this level. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a simple website that will allow anyone to see the name, manifesto, goals and some statistics about your DAO.

The end result should look like this:

### Task 1: Find a logo for your DAO (as an SVG file)
To keep things simple, we will use an SVG file as a logo. SVGs are basically text files that carry vector information about visuals.
For instance here is the Motoko Bootcamp logo as an SVG file:

```svg
<svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 95 95" version="1.1"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xml:space="preserve"

</svg>
```

Once you've find you logo simply define an immutable variable called `logo` of type `Text` and set it to the value of the SVG file.

### Task 2: Implement an helper function `getInfo`

Before we implement the webpage, we will define an helper function that will return some statistics about the DAO. The `getStats` function return a `DAOInfo` objec that contains the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the DAO.
- `manifesto`: The manifesto of the DAO.
- `goals`: The list of goals of the DAO.
- `logo`: The logo of the DAO, as an SVG file.

### Task 3: Implement the webpage

### Task 3.1: Implement an helper function `_getWebpage`

Before we implement the webpage, we will define an helper function that will return the webpage as a `Text` object. The `_getWebpage` function return a `Text` object that contains the formatted webpage. You can simply copy the following code or implement your own formatting.

```motoko
func _getWebpage() : Text {
    var webpage = "<style>" #
    "body { text-align: center; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #f0f8ff; color: #333; }" #
    "h1 { font-size: 3em; margin-bottom: 10px; }" #
    "hr { margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; }" #
    "em { font-style: italic; display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; }" #
    "ul { list-style-type: none; padding: 0; }" #
    "li { margin: 10px 0; }" #
    "li:before { content: 'ðŸ‘‰ '; }" #
    "svg { max-width: 150px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 20px auto; }" #
    "h2 { text-decoration: underline; }" #
    "</style>";

    webpage := webpage # "<div><h1>" # name # "</h1></div>";
    webpage := webpage # "<em>" # manifesto # "</em>";
    webpage := webpage # "<div>" # logo # "</div>";
    webpage := webpage # "<hr>";
    webpage := webpage # "<h2>Our goals:</h2>";
    webpage := webpage # "<ul>";
    for (goal in goals.vals()) {
        webpage := webpage # "<li>" # goal # "</li>";
    };
    webpage := webpage # "</ul>";
    return webpage;
};
```

### Task 3.2: Define the `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` types
By leveraging the `http.mo` file that is provided in the `src` folder, define the `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` types.

### Task 3.3: Implement the `http_request` query function

In Motoko, to serve a webpage, you simply need to implement a `http_request` query function. This function will be called by the Internet Computer when a user tries to access your webpage.

For instance this is how you would implement a `http_request` query function that serves a simple "Hello World" webpage:

```motoko
public query func http_request(request : HttpRequest) : async HttpResponse {
    let response = {
        body = Text.encodeUtf8("Hello world");
        headers = [("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=UTF-8")];
        status_code = 200 : Nat16;
        streaming_strategy = null
    };
    return(response)
};
```
